Hi! I'm Margaret, Founder and Owner of Longo Horse Care LLC. I started working with therapy horses, and fell in love with the work. I find that the deep connections I have made with horses and with their owners have brought joy and meaning to my life in a new way, and I look forward to helping other people disciver this joy for themselves in my continued work with horses and farms. I have experience in: 

* Stall Cleaning
* Giving Meds
* Feeding and Daily Duties
* Theraputic Sessions
